# Crypto App RealTime

I built a trading application for cryptocurrency, the application shows in real time the price of all currencies in the market, their increases, and decreases - in real-time,
The application has a variety of navigations, you can see on the home page all the currencies with their details,
You can see on the upCoin page - all the coins that have risen in the last hour and the last day
on the downCoin page-
the coins that have dropped in the last hour and the last day.
To start trading you need to register on the registration page and then log in,
There is full authentication in partnership with Firebase.
I used Redux to access API requests from anywhere in the application.
